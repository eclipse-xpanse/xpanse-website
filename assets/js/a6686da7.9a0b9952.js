Only the cloud providers can create native managed services.\\nThe consequence is that it\'s pretty hard to integrate third party SaaS islands.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the enterprises fear lock-in. There\'s no real service portability between different clouds.\\n\\nAnd even worse, cloud data is the ultimate lock-out and lock-in. The data lock-out means cloud data storage software is\\ninefficient compare to cloud data storage service. Even if we can have a software storage on a purchased virtual\\nmachine, it\'s inefficient and expensive compared to native cloud storage services.\\nThe data lock-in is because the cloud data is tightly coupled to proprietary cloud services. It\'s hard to\\nextract/export raw data from one cloud to another. Even if cloud data can be exported, it\'s not really useful without\\nthe accompanying cloud service.\\n\\nOpen Services Cloud solves:\\n\\n-   **federated**: the goal is to create an open services ecosystem that works across different clouds. Open Services\\n    Cloud solves ecosystem lockout & lack of service portability.\\n-   **open**: the purpose is to enable customers to choose the services and providers of their choice. Thanks to that, we\\n    avoid customer lock-in.\\n-   **data infrastructure based on European values**: Open Services Cloud enables European cloud providers and ecosystems\\n    to meet the needs of Europeans. Open Services Cloud open up the market, avoiding the hyperscalers to control and set\\n    the market for cloud and data services in Europe.\\n\\nOpen Services Cloud is an Open Source initiative reshaping the cloud market.\\n\\nWelcome to Open Services Cloud."}]}}')}}]);
