Today, the ecosystem is being locked out of public clouds. Only the cloud providers can create native managed services. The consequence is that it's pretty hard to integrate third party SaaS islands. On the other hand, the enterprises fear lock-in. There's no real service portability between different clouds. And even worse, cloud data is the ultimate lock-out and lock-in. The data lock-out means cloud data storage software is inefficient compare to cloud data storage service. Even if we can have a software storage on a purchased virtual machine, it's inefficient and expensive compared to native cloud storage services. The data lock-in is because the cloud data is tightly coupled to proprietary cloud services. It's hard to extract/export raw data from one cloud to another. Even if cloud data can be exported, it's not really useful without the accompanying cloud service. Open Services Cloud solves: federated: the goal is to create an open services ecosystem that works across different clouds. Open Services Cloud solves ecosystem lockout &amp; lack of service portability.open: the purpose is to enable customers to choose the services and providers of their choice. Thanks to that, we avoid customer lock-in.data infrastructure based on European values: Open Services Cloud enables European cloud providers and ecosystems to meet the needs of Europeans.

In addition, of software artifacts, software vendor describe the service using the xpanse data model.the cloud providers can easily extend their services catalog by registering services described using the xpanse data model. xpanse allows anyone to create managed services (not only the cloud provider), portable, and fully integrated within the cloud provider infrastructure. The xpanse service descriptor is a yaml fully describing the service. This descriptor is handled by the orchestrator. The orchestrator reads the deployment scripts provided as part of the service descriptor and executes it when the service is ordered. The interaction logic with the cloud provider is delegated to orchestrator plugins. The orchestrator can use one or more plugins to deal with the underlying infrastructure services and create the service resources. The orchestrator defines the following lifecycle for each service: A service is registered in the orchestrator (in a persistent store).Once registered, the service is available for the end user for deployments.the orchestrator can delete the service and with this will remove the service from the catalog. You can interact with the xpanse API using the REST API.The orchestrator, plugins and API are all managed in the xpanse runtime Spring Boot application.

This will be extended in the near future.  Credential Variable Value Sources​  After a plugin has defined credential Type as variables and its respective variable names, then the consumer of this cloud provider, then values for these variable names must be provided, and this is possible to be done from different variable sources.  This is necessary to allow all combinations where some credential variable values are fixed for an environment and some can be different for each user. For example, in the case of Openstack plugin, the Identity URL might be fixed for each xpanse instance, but the username and password can vary for each xpanse user.  xpanse User Specific Credentials​  A credential for combination of a specific CSP, CredentialType and a specific xpanse user can be added using the addCredential API method. This means for all services ordered by a xpanse user or for monitoring services which are ordered by this specific xpanse user, this added credential will be used.  This exact request body definition for each of the CSP and Credential Types can be found using getCredentialOpenApi. This method provides a link to OpenAPI definition and sample request for adding credentials for each CSP.  Credential variable values sent from this API are stored directly into CredentialCache.  OS Environment Variables​  Based on the CredentialDefinition configured in the Plugins, the xpanse runtime can be started by injecting default credential configuration variables as OS environment variables to the runtime. If values for all credential variables aren't available from other sources, then the runtime will search for credential variables from OS environment variables.  Please note that the variables from OS environment values are read as-is. It's therefore necessary to keep credential variable names unique even between two different credential types of the same CSP.  Credential Variables &quot;Joining&quot;​  As described in the above sections, for each credential type, a certain set of variables are defined. Values for allof these variables are needed for the credential to be valid.  We join credential variable values from all the sources mentioned in the above sectionsto get the final credential variable values that will be used for connecting to the CSP.  Credential values are read from different values and joined into one single set of all required credential variable values of a given type.  If the value of a credential variable is available in multiple sources, then the value coming from the source of higher priority is used.  Service Deployment​  During the service deployment, all the values for the variables defined in the CredentialDefinition is derived from different sources in a priority sequence provided below  CredentialType and variables from deploy variables.

This is the latest LTS release of MySQL.  Default Configuration​  The above command will start the xpanse runtime with the following default configurations:  MySQL running on the same machine where xpanse is running. (Same localhost)Database is listening on port 3306.Name of the database is xpanse. This must be created on the DB server. It won't be automatically created.  The Default configuration file can be found here.  Overriding Default Configuration​  We can override the above two default configurations by starting the application as below by replacing the placeholders with actual values.  java -jar xpanse-runtime-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \\ -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql \\ -Dspring.datasource.username=&lt;replace-with-db-username&gt; \\ -Dspring.datasource.password=&lt;replace-with-db-password&gt; \\ -D spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://&lt;replace-with-db-hostname&gt;:&lt;replace-with-db-port&gt;/&lt;replace-with-db-name&gt;   Note: It's safe to provide the database-related properties as environment variables rather than passing them directly in the command line. In case of this, the same property name must be set in UPPERCASE and underscore separated instead of dot for all variables.  Note: Using this startup command, the database can run on any machine that's reachable from the xpanse runtime application.  MySQL as a Docker Container​  MySQL offers official Docker images for running a database as a container. More details can be found here on the official page of MySQL website here and on DockerHub here.  Starting new container​  While starting the MySQL docker container for the first time, we can configure database-host, database-port anddatabase-name as below and the same can be used in starting the xpanse runtime using the command described  above.  docker pull mysql:8.1.0   By starting the container with the below command, the database is started by automatically configuring the database with xpanse database name, database user and password. In addition to that, password for the DB root user can also be updated to the value of our choice.  docker run --name ${container-name} \\ -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=&lt;replace-with-db-root-password&gt; \\ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=&lt;replace-with-db-name&gt; \\ -e MYSQL_USER=&lt;replace-with-db-user&gt; \\ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=&lt;replace-with-db-password&gt; \\ -p 3306:&lt;replace-with-db-port&gt; -d mysql:8.1.0   Note: To avoid passing database related properties in command line, we can use the --env-file option of the docker run command to store all sensitive data.
