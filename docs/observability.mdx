# Observability

xpanse stack is built with observability in mind. It provides traces, metrics and logging at different levels
which helps to monitor all systems involved in the xpanse stack.

### OpenTelemetry

![OpenTelemetry](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSyN7sCv7Y3XWDuSl3Pz0KSEBpO8mryvl_l5c7qbQv3cw&s)

As a default implementation, we use <Link url={'https://opentelemetry.io/'} name={'OpenTelemetry'} /> to generate and collect telemetry data. The OpenTelemetry
provided SDKs and auto instrumentation features helps to generate all necessary data with no additional implementation. Using
OpenTelemetry provides an advantage that, we generate data based on standards specified by OpenTelemetry and thereby gives
us the flexibility to feed this data to any OpenTelemetry protocol supported backends.

### Telemetry Data Generated

#### Logs

All applications involved in the xpanse stack, generates logs with useful information to trace a request
end-to-end.
Logs have metadata which provides very high level of traceability.

The OpenTelemetry auto instrumentation SDK is then used to export all generated logs from existing logging frameworks to
OTEL collector.

#### Metrics and Traces

All applications are provided with an option to enable OpenTelemetry's auto instrumentation features which then
generates metrics and traces.

### Telemetry Data collector

We can use any product which implements the OpenTelemetry specifications for collecting data. The collector's endpoint
must then be configured in the data producing systems for forwarding the generated Telemetry data to the collector.

### Components Generating Observability Data

- xpanse - activated using spring profile `opentelemetry`
- terraform-boot - activated using spring profile `opentelemetry`
- policy-man - activated by starting OpenTelemetry's instrumentation process together with policy-man
- zitadel - enabled by default

### Sample Full Stack Observability

An example on how to enable auto instrumentation for all xpanse components and then export data to OTEL collector which
can
be later feed into Grafana monitoring stack can be
found <Link name={'here'} url={'https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse-relops/blob/main/testbed/full-stack/docker-compose.yml'}/>.
