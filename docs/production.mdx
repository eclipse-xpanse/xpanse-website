# Running in Production

To run xpanse in production, we must ensure that all necessary <Link name='dependent systems in the stack' url='architecture#xpanse-stack' isOpenInNewTab={false} />
are also deployed together as a stack.

All required <Link name='profiles and configurations' url='./spring-profiles' isOpenInNewTab={false} /> must be known beforehand.

## Run using jar

Download the released runtime jar from GitHub releases. You can get the latest from <Link name={'here'} url={'https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse/releases/latest'}/>.

After downloading, we can start the jar file using the Java command.

```shell
java -jar xpanse-runtime-*.jar
```

## Run using Docker image

You can start the runtime using our released docker image, and this is the preferred way. This image
contains all necessary tools preinstalled. Below is an example of running a single instance of xpanse.

```shell
$ docker pull ghcr.io/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse:${release-version}
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name xpanse -e "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=oauth,zitadel,mysql" ghcr.io/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse:${release-version}
$ docker logs xpanse
```

:::danger Avoid properties in command line
It's safe to provide all properties as environment variables rather than passing them directly in the command line.
In case of this, the same property name must be set in UPPERCASE for all four variables.
For running, using docker image, we can use the ` --env-file` option of the `docker run` command to store all sensitive data.
Again, here the property names must be in UPPERCASE.

#### Running API behind a proxy

For running the runtime application behind a proxy, we must ensure that the proxy forwards the
correct `X-Forwarded-*`headers to the API.
This is necessary since the API has some features where the
links to HTML pages are returned and this link will have the correct protocol and host only when
these headers are set.

In the case of NGINX, the configuration will look like this

```nginx configuration
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
proxy_set_header Host $host;
```
