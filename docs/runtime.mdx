# Runtime

Xpanse runtime is the running module built on SpringBoot.

`Xpanse Runtime` has two ways to start, one is to use the local terraform module, the other is Use
the remote terraform-boot service. The remote terraform-boot service is used by default.

## Pre-Requisites

1. If using local terraform module, the `Xpanse Runtime` host must have `Terraform CLI` installed.

2. If using remote terraform-boot service, a remote `Terrafom-boot` service must be
   deployed/started.More details about the Terraform-boot project can be found <Link name={'here'} url={'https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/terraform-boot/blob/main/README.md'} />.

3. Fully configured Zitadel instance.

## Properties and Environment Variables

Xpanse has integration to multiple systems, and the aim is also to keep the system as flexible as
possible and to cover all use-cases possible. Therefore, there are some configuration properties
that the developer and the production administrators must take care of before starting/deploying
xpanse.

1. Configuration properties of authentication layer.
   Documented <Link name={'here'} url={'./authentication-authorization'} isOpenInNewTab={false}/>.
2. Configuration properties of database layer. Documented <Link name={'here'} url={'./database#mysql-db'} isOpenInNewTab={false}/>.
3. Plugin activation variables. Documented <Link name={'here'} url={'./plugins#plugin-activation'} isOpenInNewTab={false}/>.

### Local Development

#### Clone and Build

Clone the project using the command below

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse
$ cd xpanse
```

Then compile the entire project using the below command

```shell
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```

#### Run

Ensure all properties mentioned in the <Link name={'above section'} url={'./runtime#properties-and-environment-variables'} isOpenInNewTab={false}/> are
correctly set.

##### From Command Line

If you have a fully configured Zitadel instance running on your local system, then you can use the
below command to start the application by passing all variables.

To start the application from the command line, run the below application from the root of the
project.

```shell
$ java -jar runtime/target/xpanse-runtime-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
--authorization-api-client-id=${client-id} \
--authorization-api-client-secret=${client-secret} \
--authorization-swagger-ui-client-id=${swagger-ui-cleint-id}
```

If you would like to use our `zitadel-testbed`, then start the server using the below command. This
will automatically set properties required for connecting to our Zitadel test bed.

```shell
$ cd runtime/target
$ java -jar xpanse-runtime-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=zitadel,zitadel-testbed
```

By default, Xpanse Runtime starts using Terraform-boot. If you want to use local terraform, just
don't activate the terraform-boot scenario in the application.properties configuration file.

```properties
spring.profiles.active=zitadel,zitadel-testbed
```

##### From IDE

Or the application can be started using the IDE by executing the main application directly. Below is
the example from IntellijIdea

![img.png](../static/img/ide-run.png)

You must see the below messages in the console.

```shell
   _  __   ____    ____ _   ____    _____  ___
  | |/_/  / __ \  / __ `/  / __ \  / ___/ / _ \
 _>  <   / /_/ / / /_/ /  / / / / (__  ) /  __/
/_/|_|  / .___/  \__,_/  /_/ /_/ /____/  \___/
       /_/

        xpanse 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT (2023)
13:44:19.633 [main] INFO  o.e.xpanse.runtime.XpanseApplication - Starting XpanseApplication using Java 17.0.5 with PID 7344
13:44:19.645 [main] INFO  o.e.xpanse.runtime.XpanseApplication - No active profile set, falling back to 1 default profile: "default"
13:44:22.211 [main] INFO  o.e.x.o.FileOrchestratorStorage - No other storage beans found. Using default file storage.
13:44:23.878 [main] WARN  o.e.x.o.OrchestratorService - No xpanse plugins loaded by the runtime.
13:44:23.886 [main] INFO  o.e.xpanse.runtime.XpanseApplication - Started XpanseApplication in 5.029 seconds (process running for 5.992)
```

You can check the status of the runtime by opening the swagger UI from any browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

### Production

Ensure all properties mentioned in the <Link name={'above section'} url={'./runtime#properties-and-environment-variables'} isOpenInNewTab={false}/> are
correctly set.

#### Run using jar

Download the released runtime jar from GitHub releases. You can get the latest from <Link name={'here'} url={'https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse/releases/latest'}/>.

After downloading, follow the same steps mentioned in <Link name={'this'} url={'runtime#from-command-line'}/> section.

#### Run using Docker image

You can start the runtime using our released docker image, and this is the preferred way. This image
contains all necessary tools preinstalled.

```shell
$ docker pull ghcr.io/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse:${release-version}
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name xpanse -e "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=zitadel,mariadb" ghcr.io/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse:${release-version}
$ docker logs xpanse
```

> **Note:** It is safe to provide all properties as environment variables rather than passing them
> directly in the command line.
> In case of this, the same property name must be set in UPPERCASE for all 4 variables.
>
> For running, using docker image, we can use the ` --env-file` option of the `
docker run` command to store all sensitive data.
> Again here the property names must be in UPPERCASE.

#### Running API behind a proxy

For running the runtime application behind a proxy, we must ensure that the proxy forwards the
correct `X-Forwarded-*`headers to the API. This is necessary as the API has some features where the
links to html pages are returned and this link will have the correct protocol and host only when
these headers are set.

In the case of Nginx, the configuration will look like this

```nginx configuration
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
proxy_set_header Host $host;
```
